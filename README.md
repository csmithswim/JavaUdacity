Contains work with Java from Udacity and other web resources while I learn Java and begin to work with a new IDE

Java is case sensitive.
Variable names must start with a letter, no whitespace.

Declaring        Initializing
String player = "Jack";


long integers store larger numbers.
Both don't store fractions.
double can store fractions and long numbers.
Integers are limited to 10 digits. 
int maxInt= 324235352;
long muchMore = 353535353*46464646
double = fraction = 99.275;

To make comments in Java you use // or /* */

When doing arithmetic with Java, make sure to force a decimal place if you are storing the result in a double variable, i.e. double div = 5/2.0
When a double variable gets converted to an integer, such as when 5/2, is known as truncation.
You can also truncate with casting like so. 
int approx = (int) future;
double accurate = (double) x/y;

char is a character, it stores just one character and is used with a '', single numbers such as '2' can be stored too.

String fullText = "Hello";
char answer = 'b';

boolean just contain true or false
boolean fact = true;

For variables in java you have to specify the data type, i.e. int, str, etc.

Variables can be declared like so: int sum;

To console.log something in Java it is 
System.out.println();

To declare a string variable:
String driver;
driver = "Joe"; 
This is known as a string literal

driver.length();
Counts the numbers of letters in a string

driver.toUpperCase();
Capitalizes all letters

These methods require the variable to be reassigned to be used.

The + can be used to concatanate strings.

The print line command can use variables and strings to concatenate.
